# Experimentation on cell instance segmentation
This repo holds some experimentation on the Kaggle Sartorius Cell Instance semgentation challenge data.

# Setup
This repo is somewhat self-contained. It does not include any data delivered through kaggle's api, though. In order to run the code in this repo:
1. Install the required python libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download the dataset through the kaggle api (kaggle account required) `kaggle competitions download -c sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation`
3. Unzip the dataset `unzip sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation.zip`
